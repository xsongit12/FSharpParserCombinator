# FSharpParserCombinator
A simple parser combinator library written in F Sharp. Shamelessly based off of "Understanding Parser Combinators" from F# 
For Fun and Profit. Personal Project to understand functional languages and basic parsing.

## Installation

I mean, I guess you can just clone the repo and load the file "CombinatorialParser.fs" in F Sharp.
This exposes the library for use.
